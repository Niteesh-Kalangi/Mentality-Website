			Resonance breathing is a light, slow, and natural form of breathing that slowly reduces anxiety. It is also known as coherent
      breathing because of it's consistent nature. The term resonance comes from a term used in physics, which is oscillation.
      The resonance frequency describes the frequency of an oscillation that allows the oscillator to express maximal amplitude.
      Oscillations happen in all living systems, whether it is heart rate, blood pressure, or metabollic activity. Breathing
      is actually one of the rare oscillating systems that is under our control, and therefore, we can optimize it. Resonance
      breathing is the breathing technique that regulates the oscillation of breathing in a way that achieves the resonance
      frequency. This optimization also applies to oscillating systems that are dependent on breathing. This breathing technique
      has a regulating affect on the autonomic nervous systems and other mechanisms like the circulatory system and hemodynamics (which both oscillate and depend on breathing).

		<ol type="1">
				<li>
						Lie down if you can or sit down, and close your eyes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Slowly and gently breath in through your nose for around 6 seconds. Make sure you don't fill your lungs full of air every time you breathe.
					</li>
					<li>
						Slowly exhale for a count of around 6 seconds. Gently and naturally let the air leave your body without force. Make sure you don't exhale too much to the point where you are gasping for breath. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Continue this breathing for up to 10 minutes. This is a technique for when you have a bit more time. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Breathe at a rate of around 3-7 breaths per minute
					</li>
					<li>
						After you finish breathing, you can take some more time to lay down, be in touch with your body, and gauge how you feel.
					</li>
					<li>
						Do this breathing in a quiet environment, as this is not only a physically calming exercise, but a mentally calming one as well
					</li>
