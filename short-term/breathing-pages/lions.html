			Lion's breath is another type of pranayama that alleviates stress. It is also known as simhasana in sanskrit (meaning lion). This is a more physical style of breathing, meaning it can also bring a facet of physical relief of tension as well.
      If you are about to speak in front of a crowd or even sing, this can help you do so because of the face and neck relaxation
      it provides. Additionally, it helps stimulate your throat and chest to improve your breathing. This is breathing that
      is unique because of its connection to the thyroid gland, known to be your energy center. It can also alleviate many
      toxins in the body.

				<li>
						Sit down in a comfortable position. It is preferred for you to sit in a crossed-leg position or a kneeling position, but
          sitting on a chair is fine as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					Open your hands with your fingers spread out, and place your palms on your knees
					</li>
					<li>
						Open your mouth wide and stick your tongue downwards as far as it goes. Keep your eyes wide open as well
					</li>
					<li>
						Inhale breathing deeply and feel your face expand in doing so
					</li>
					<li>
						Exhale fully, making the "ha" sound as you do so. Continue making the sound until you are finished exhaling, as if to roar
          like a lion. Additionally, feel your face muscles contract while exhaling
					</li>
					<li>
						Make sure you focus your vision on a specific point. You can focus on your nose, the space in between your eyebrows, or just
          empty space
					</li>
					<li>
						Repeat steps 2-6 for a few times
					</li>
