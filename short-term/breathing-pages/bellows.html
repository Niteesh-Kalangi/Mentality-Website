			Bellows Breath is a popular breathing technique known as Bhastrika in Sanskrit. This form of breathing is a very energetic
      one, and is very good at increasing your physical output at a given time. It is traditionally known to increase your
      life force (Prana), energize your body, and clear/purify the mind. It is acts as a productive and natural alternative
      to energy drinks or coffee. If you are feeling "slow" or are experiencing some haziness in the mind, bellows breath can
      clear that up. An additional benefit of this breathing is that it leads to long-term weight loss. It does so by improving
      digestion and increasing your metabolism.

				<li>
						Sit down in a comfortable position. Make sure your posture is straight, your chest is opened up, and your shoulders are going
          upwards and outwards
				</li>
				<li>
					Close your hands into fists, and put them right over your shoulders to start
					</li>
					<li>
						Inhale deeply through your nose for around 1 second, and as you are inhaling, raise your hands directly upward as if you
          are lifting weights
					</li>
					<li>
						After you finished inhaling, exhale very quickly (as fast as possible) through your nose while rapidly bringing your hands
          to their original position -- right above the shoulder. The exhale should be done very aggresively, swiftly releasing
          all of the built up air
					</li>
					<li>
						Exhale fully, making the "ha" sound as you do so. Continue making the sound until you are finished exhaling, as if to roar
          like a lion. Additionally, feel your face muscles contract while exhaling
					</li>
					<li>
						The amount of times you repeat this breathing depends on how intense it is on your body. Do not do it for too long as you
          might feel too light-headed afterwards (although a little light-headedness is good). 10 repetitions is recommended
          to begin
					</li>
					<li>
						For the last repetition, repeat the same steps, but inhale very slowly and exhale very slowly
					</li>
					<li>
						Rest and recooperate for a while after 1 round of repetition, and start another round if you are feeling fine. You can do
          3 or more rounds of repetitions for best results.
					</li>
					<li>
						Since this is a very physically expressive breathing style, it is recommended to do it privately for the best experience.
				</li>
