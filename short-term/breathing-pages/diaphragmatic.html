			This type of breathing can better execute full oxygen exchange. This style of breathing is also known as deep breathing because
			it uses the full capacity of the lungs, making the diaphragm move as you breathe. This style of breathing is more efficient
			in terms of oxygen consumption. This kind of breathing also stimulates the vagus nerve which reduces the flight or fight
			response in humans. Consequently, diaphramagtic breathing lowers heart rate and stress levels.

						If you can, start by lying on your back, but if not, sit down somewhere comfortable for you.
				</li>
				<li>
					Place one of your hands on your stomach and the other on your chest to be able to feel the movment of your diaphragm.
					</li>
					<li>
						Slowly inhale through your nose for a few seconds, and feel your stomach press up against your hand. Continue inhaling until
				your stomach has fully expanded for best results.

					<li>
						Keep the other hand as still as possible by making sure your chest stays in place
					</li>
					<li>
						Pucker your lips as if you are about to blow a bubble
