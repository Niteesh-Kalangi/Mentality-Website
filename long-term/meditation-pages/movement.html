      This type of meditation is a great way to combine physical activity and mental relief. Movement meditation works to energize
				the body and the mind through calm breathing and movement. Breathing is key to stress relief and long-term health in-general,
				and this vital mechanism in our body is optimized by exercise, which is why movement meditation works so well. Additionally,
				this form of meditation allows us to experience sensations of the body at work as well as gravity and energy, helping
				us feel more in tune with the world.

      <li>Yoga
						<ul>
							<li>
								A practice that combines the mind and the body, including poses, breathing, and meditation, which are all important aspects
								of yoga. This helps lower the heart rate and blood pressure, naturally reducing stress. It also helps people focus
								their energy and concentrate on their thoughts, allowing them to find more peace in their body and mind over time.
								You can refer to our page about yoga for more information
							</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Walking/Running
						<ul>
							<li>
								A great way to let your mind wander and develop your thoughts. The flow of oxygen through your body during this process will
								help clear your mind and freshen your body. Research shows that walking promotes the release of endorphins in your
								body, which are chemicals that stimulate relaxation and can brighten your mood.
							</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Gardening/Cleaning
						<ul>
							<li>
								Gardening is proven to be a relaxing activity that reduces cortisol levels (a chemical produced in response to stress). This
								is likely because of the richness of oxygen in these areas. In fact, hospitals have started to include gardens in
								their grounds to help hospital workers relieve pressures and stress.
							</li>
							<li>
								Cleaning is similar in how it can call for a bit of exercise, which, as you know, is already a great way to reduce stress.
								Additionally, however, the end result of cleaning itself can significantly reduce stress, as it greatly and positively
								impacts the environment around you, which helps the cause. You can refer to our page about environment for more information.
