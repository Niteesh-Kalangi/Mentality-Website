      This type of meditation is great to stay grounded and stay in the present moment. It is based on being mindful of what is happening around you and it will eventually work to build a deep acceptance of your circumstances and situations around you. It accomplishes this by making you focus on what you are experiencing during
			meditation, such as your breathing or your thoughts and emotions. Doing this during meditation is particularly helpful
			because it allows you to completely immerse yourself in all of your thoughts with no distraction and boosted concentration.
			Additionally, this type of meditation is good for those who don’t have teachers to guide them, as it can be easily practiced alone.

      <li>
						Get in a comfortable place. This should be somewhere familiar, where all distractions are removed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set a timer. This step is recommended because it allows you to forget about the amount of time you are spending, creating
						an environment where you can focus with no other concerns
					</li>
					<li>
						Focus on your breathing. Become aware of your breath, the way air is moving through your body, and the mechanisms you use
						to breathe. Concentrate on the sensations you feel as you breathe.
					</li>
					<li>
						Notice your thoughts. Aim to recognize, understand, and get comfortable with the thoughts you have instead of trying to stop
						them. Let thoughts come to you freely and when they do, just take note of them. No contemplation is necessary. Imagine
						these thoughts as clouds moving through your mind, slowly passing by with varying form and shape.
					</li>
					<li>
						Take breaks. In this form of meditation, you can easily get carried away in your thoughts, and this can even cause additional
						stress if you aren’t careful. Be sure to take breaks to process your thoughts before resuming.
					</li>
