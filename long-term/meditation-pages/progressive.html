      This type of meditation is also known as body-scan meditation because it allows you to focus on parts of your body one at
				a time. It is aimed at reducing tension in the body, thus promoting relaxation. This type of meditation often involves
				the tightening and relaxing of every single muscle group in the body until the entire body is loose and relaxed. Additionally,
				the method is frequently pictured as a smooth wave that flows through your body, calming each part it passes and relieving
				any tension. This activity is great to unwind and relieve stress before going to sleep.

    <ol type= "1">
      					<li>
						Get in a comfortable space that supports all parts of your body. Also, make sure you are in a position where your muscles
						can be broadened and stretched.
					</li>
					<li>
						Think of all the muscle groups in your body that you want to stress. These should include your upper and lower arms, your
						chest and abdominal muscles, and your lower and upper leg muscles.
					</li>
					<li>
						Take a deep breath and tense your first muscle group for around 8 seconds. Make sure you are stressing your muscles to a
						point where you can feel it prominently, but not to a point where it causes pain.

					</li>
					<li>
						Breathe out and quickly relax the muscle group that you stressed
					</li>
					<li>
						Wait for at least 10 more seconds before moving on to the next muscle group. Note how the particular muscle group you stressed
						feels.
					</li>
					<li>
						Repeat the previous steps for all muscle groups, and when finished, we recommend stretching to loosen up all of your joints
						even more.
