			<h1 class="information-topic">1. Mindfulness Meditation</h1>
			<p class="information-topic-info">This type of meditation is great to stay grounded and stay in the present moment. It is
				based on being mindful of what is happening around you and it will eventually work to build a deep acceptance of your
				circumstances and situations around you. It accomplishes this by making you focus on what you are experiencing during
				meditation, such as your breathing or your thoughts and emotions. Doing this during meditation is particularly helpful
				because it allows you to completely immerse yourself in all of your thoughts with no distraction and boosted concentration.
				Additionally, this type of meditation is good for those who don’t have teachers to guide them, as it can be easily practiced
				alone.
			</p>
			<div class="information-steps-container">
				<h1 class="information-topic-steps-header">Procedure:</h1>
				<ol class="information-steps-list" type="1">
					<li>
						Get in a comfortable place. This should be somewhere familiar, where all distractions are removed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set a timer. This step is recommended because it allows you to forget about the amount of time you are spending, creating
						an environment where you can focus with no other concerns
					</li>
					<li>
						Focus on your breathing. Become aware of your breath, the way air is moving through your body, and the mechanisms you use
						to breathe. Concentrate on the sensations you feel as you breathe.
					</li>
					<li>
						Notice your thoughts. Aim to recognize, understand, and get comfortable with the thoughts you have instead of trying to stop
						them. Let thoughts come to you freely and when they do, just take note of them. No contemplation is necessary. Imagine
						these thoughts as clouds moving through your mind, slowly passing by with varying form and shape.
					</li>
					<li>
						Take breaks. In this form of meditation, you can easily get carried away in your thoughts, and this can even cause additional
						stress if you aren’t careful. Be sure to take breaks to process your thoughts before resuming.
					</li>

				2. Movement Meditation
			</h1>
			<p class="information-topic-info">
				This type of meditation is a great way to combine physical activity and mental relief. Movement meditation works to energize
				the body and the mind through calm breathing and movement. Breathing is key to stress relief and long-term health in-general,
				and this vital mechanism in our body is optimized by exercise, which is why movement meditation works so well. Additionally,
				this form of meditation allows us to experience sensations of the body at work as well as gravity and energy, helping
				us feel more in tune with the world.

			<div class="information-steps-container">
				<h1 class="information-topic-steps-header">Steps:</h1>
				<ol class="information-steps-list" type="1">
					<li>Yoga
						<ul>
							<li>
								A practice that combines the mind and the body, including poses, breathing, and meditation, which are all important aspects
								of yoga. This helps lower the heart rate and blood pressure, naturally reducing stress. It also helps people focus
								their energy and concentrate on their thoughts, allowing them to find more peace in their body and mind over time.
								You can refer to our page about yoga for more information
							</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Walking/Running
						<ul>
							<li>
								A great way to let your mind wander and develop your thoughts. The flow of oxygen through your body during this process will
								help clear your mind and freshen your body. Research shows that walking promotes the release of endorphins in your
								body, which are chemicals that stimulate relaxation and can brighten your mood.
							</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Gardening/Cleaning
						<ul>
							<li>
								Gardening is proven to be a relaxing activity that reduces cortisol levels (a chemical produced in response to stress). This
								is likely because of the richness of oxygen in these areas. In fact, hospitals have started to include gardens in
								their grounds to help hospital workers relieve pressures and stress.
							</li>
							<li>
								Cleaning is similar in how it can call for a bit of exercise, which, as you know, is already a great way to reduce stress.
								Additionally, however, the end result of cleaning itself can significantly reduce stress, as it greatly and positively
								impacts the environment around you, which helps the cause. You can refer to our page about environment for more information.

				3. Progressive Relaxation
			</h1>
			<p class="information-topic-info">
				This type of meditation is also known as body-scan meditation because it allows you to focus on parts of your body one at
				a time. It is aimed at reducing tension in the body, thus promoting relaxation. This type of meditation often involves
				the tightening and relaxing of every single muscle group in the body until the entire body is loose and relaxed. Additionally,
				the method is frequently pictured as a smooth wave that flows through your body, calming each part it passes and relieving
				any tension. This activity is great to unwind and relieve stress before going to sleep.
			</p>
			<div class="information-steps-container">
				<h1 class="information-topic-steps-header">Procedure:</h1>
				<ol class="information-steps-list" type="1">
					<li>
						Get in a comfortable space that supports all parts of your body. Also, make sure you are in a position where your muscles
						can be broadened and stretched.
					</li>
					<li>
						Think of all the muscle groups in your body that you want to stress. These should include your upper and lower arms, your
						chest and abdominal muscles, and your lower and upper leg muscles.
					</li>
					<li>
						Take a deep breath and tense your first muscle group for around 8 seconds. Make sure you are stressing your muscles to a
						point where you can feel it prominently, but not to a point where it causes pain.

					</li>
					<li>
						Breathe out and quickly relax the muscle group that you stressed
					</li>
					<li>
						Wait for at least 10 more seconds before moving on to the next muscle group. Note how the particular muscle group you stressed
						feels.
					</li>
					<li>
						Repeat the previous steps for all muscle groups, and when finished, we recommend stretching to loosen up all of your joints
						even more.

				4. Visualization Meditation/Guided Imagery
			</h1>
			<p class="information-topic-info">
				This type of meditation aims to enhance feelings of peace, serenity, and relaxation by visualizing positive imagery, events, and outcomes or using affirmations to calm the mind. This meditation allows one to soothe the mind while the body is in a relaxed state. It can also be very effective in reducing stress long-term because it can help manifest visualizations of situations you want to be in or places you want to be in the future, and those manifestations themselves can relieve stress and give you direction. Visualization meditation is also key to achieving your goals and can help reduce the stress that comes with the fear of not achieving your goals.
			</p>
			<div class="information-steps-container">
				<h1 class="information-topic-steps-header">Procedure:</h1>
				<ol class="information-steps-list" type="1">
					<li>
						Think about where you want to be, what your aspirations are, and when you are the happiest
					</li>
					<li>
						Close your eyes, slow your breath, and visualize what you thought about. Imagine yourself in a position of success or a landscape of happiness. Visualize a place where you are calm and happy
					</li>
					<li>
						Use all of your senses to better envision yourself in the image you put yourself in. What are you hearing, touching, or smelling? Are there any signature textures you are feeling or fragrances you are smelling? Are you blinded by a bright sky or pounded with aromatic scents?
					</li>
					<li>
						Envision yourself moving forward through the vision and continue breathing as you do so, observing the scene you have created
					</li>
					<li>
						With each second that passes, envision harmony and peace entering your body and stress, sadness, and solitude leaving it. If you are visualizing your goals and doubts are entering your mind, combat them with a mantra like “I can do this” or “Have strength.”
					</li>
					<li>
						When you feel satisfied, leave the surroundings you have created for yourself and enter reality by opening your eyes. Think about what you envisioned and be sure to act on that.
					</li>
