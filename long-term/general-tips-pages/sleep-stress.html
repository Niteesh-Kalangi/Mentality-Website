It is known that a lack of sleep causes stress and stress causes a lack of sleep. A survey conducted by Stress in America™
				shows that 42 percent of Americans report that their sleep quality is fair or poor, and 43 percent report that stress
				has caused them to lie awake at night in the past month. Additionally, 21 percent of adults reported that they felt more
				stressed when they did not get enough sleep and this percentage went up for adults who reported higher average stress
				levels. This cyclical form of causation between stress and lack of sleep is known as the sleep-stress cycle. This cycle
				also greatly affects teens as well. From the same survey, 35 percent of teens reported that stress caused them to lay
				awake at night at least once in the past month. Additionally, 39 percent of teens reported that during the school year,
				they felt more stressed when they didn’t get enough sleep. The reason why stress affects sleep so greatly is because
				it causes alert responses in the brain, reducing the ability to sleep. Sleep can affect stress in many ways, one of which
				is that lower levels of sleep can increase blood pressure, leading to more stress. A lack of sleep also leads to the
				release of the hormone cortisol, which is the hormone responsible for your body's fight or flight response.

				Social Media
			</h1>
			<p class="information-topic-info">
				One reason social media can be stress-inducing is because it is very addictive. Firstly, for a lot of people, phones are
				an essential part of life and we use them in so many different ways. Conveniently, this device is also home to apps like
				Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, creating an instant temptation to scroll through social media whenever you use your
				phone. About 75% of Facebook users check the site at least once a day, and about 60% of Instagram users do the same.
				Once you get on a social media site, there are many reasons why you may end up feeling more stressed once leaving it.
				One factor of social media that causes significant amounts of stress is the “perfect lives perception,” or a belief that
				everyone you see on social media is ahead of you and has a better life than you. It can be very easy to fall into this
				trap of thinking considering that people on social media can post manipulated photos and specifically selected events
				in their life that may make it seem like they have no problems. In fact, 64% of people admit to editing the photos they
				post online. Additionally, social media can make you feel left out if you are made aware of an event that you weren’t
				invited to or weren’t able to attend. All of this contributes to stress that arises from unrealistic expectations of
				ourselves based on what we see on social media. Another way social media causes stress is through misinformation. The
				value of facts seems to be decreasing, as many people sometimes seek out and share things they already believe over facts.
				Nearly 25% of people say they've shared a fake political news story, and some say they've done so on purpose. This is
				why it is common nowadays to be stressed out about what is real, what isn’t, and how potential misinformation can affect
				your life.

					Tips to better manage your use of social media:
				</h1>
				<ol class="information-steps-list" type="1">
					<li>
						Keep in mind that there are many aspects of their life people do not post, from job losses to unflattering photos.
					</li>
					<li>
						Be attentive to your feelings as you scroll. By acknowledging when you feel a bit jealous, you can learn to overcome that
						feeling much easier.
					</li>
					<li>
						Limit the time you spend on social media by setting screen time limits for certain apps or keeping a log in your notes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Check the information you see on social media for validity by looking and multiple news outlets you trust

					</li>
					<li>
						Know when to leave an argument on social media behind and agree to disagree.

			<p class="information-topic-info">
				A lot of the time, the stress that pervades our lives can be based on external factors that are out of our control. Sometimes,
				we have to accept that stress is a part of being human and worrying about something is simply a natural human instinct.
				However, there is always something you can do to minimize your stress levels or help cope with it. For example, if you
				are in school and your classes are causing you an amount of stress that you cannot bear, drop some of those classes.
				This is clearly easier said than done because of all of the different pressures you may have on you, but your mental
				health is what should take precedence over everything else. Additionally, you should always feel comfortable asking people
				around you for help. Let your teacher know that your workload is too much, talk to your guidance counselor at school
				about some of your problems, and share your struggles with considerate family members. Even if you don’t have many of
				those support systems, there is always a way to find help. For example, you can contact online sources such as <a
				 href="https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/">Samaritans</a>
				or get professional help from local therapists. If you feel that your issue with stress is much deeper than surface level,
				contacting a professional near you is the best option.

					General tips:
				</h1>
				<ol class="information-steps-list" type="1">
					<li>
						Ensure that you have a strong support system around you to lift you up during any of your tough times. Your support system
						— friends, family, and coworkers — may be your best asset in the fight against overwhelming stress. These are the people
						that can recognize when you are struggling, offer to listen to you voice your frustrations and worries, and then spend
						time with you to come up with solutions

					</li>
					<li>
						Use the resources readily available to you. This website is an example of a great resource to cope with stress, so if you
						are finding yourself here, you are probably already doing a good job with this. However, you can also use stress/anxiety
						hotlines like the ones offered by <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline">Samhsa</a>
						or you can speak to online therapists.
					</li>
					<li>
						Seek professional help. If stress has been affecting you to an uncontrollable point, please seek professional help. There
						are many doctors, psychologists, and therapists who are professionally trained to help you ease your stress, so don’t
						be afraid to use those resources.

				<ol class="information-steps-list" type="1">
					<li>
						Balance work and relaxation- Make sure you aren’t spending too much time working and intentionally save time every day for
						at least some relaxation, preferably outdoors.
					</li>
					<li>
						Build in Regular Exercise- Refer to our exercise and diet page for more information.

					</li>
					<li>
						Eat Well and Limit Alcohol and Stimulants- Alcohol, nicotine and caffeine may give you the illusion of stress relief, but
						significantly worsen stress in the long run. Well-nourished bodies cope better with stress, so in general, keep your
						body clean of any harmful substances.

					</li>
					<li>
						Connect with Supportive People- Talking with other people leads to the release of hormones that reduce stress. Lean on people
						who are willing to listen to you and engage in productive conversations.

					</li>
					<li>
						Carve out Hobby Time- Engage in activities that bring you pleasure and joy; research shows that reduces stress by almost
						half and lowers your heart rate as well. This can also help you express yourself, which is a great way to release all
						of that pent up stress.

					</li>
					<li>
						Practice Meditation, Stress Reduction or Yoga- Refer to our meditation or yoga page for more information.

					</li>
					<li>
						Sleep Enough- Refer to our page about sleep’s effects on stress for more information.

					</li>
					<li>
						Bond with a Pet- Many studies show that spending any amount of time with a pet can reduce anxiety levels almost by half.

					</li>
					<li>
						See a Counselor, Coach or Therapist- Refer to the seeking help page for more information
