One reason social media can be stress-inducing is because it is very addictive. Firstly, for a lot of people, phones are
				an essential part of life and we use them in so many different ways. Conveniently, this device is also home to apps like
				Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, creating an instant temptation to scroll through social media whenever you use your
				phone. About 75% of Facebook users check the site at least once a day, and about 60% of Instagram users do the same.
				Once you get on a social media site, there are many reasons why you may end up feeling more stressed once leaving it.
				One factor of social media that causes significant amounts of stress is the “perfect lives perception,” or a belief that
				everyone you see on social media is ahead of you and has a better life than you. It can be very easy to fall into this
				trap of thinking considering that people on social media can post manipulated photos and specifically selected events
				in their life that may make it seem like they have no problems. In fact, 64% of people admit to editing the photos they
				post online. Additionally, social media can make you feel left out if you are made aware of an event that you weren’t
				invited to or weren’t able to attend. All of this contributes to stress that arises from unrealistic expectations of
				ourselves based on what we see on social media. Another way social media causes stress is through misinformation. The
				value of facts seems to be decreasing, as many people sometimes seek out and share things they already believe over facts.
				Nearly 25% of people say they've shared a fake political news story, and some say they've done so on purpose. This is
				why it is common nowadays to be stressed out about what is real, what isn’t, and how potential misinformation can affect
				your life.
