      How to cope: 
    </p>
    <ol>
					<li>
						Balance work and relaxation- Make sure you aren’t spending too much time working and intentionally save time every day for
						at least some relaxation, preferably outdoors.
					</li>
					<li>
						Build in Regular Exercise- Refer to our exercise and diet page for more information.

					</li>
					<li>
						Eat Well and Limit Alcohol and Stimulants- Alcohol, nicotine and caffeine may give you the illusion of stress relief, but
						significantly worsen stress in the long run. Well-nourished bodies cope better with stress, so in general, keep your
						body clean of any harmful substances.

					</li>
					<li>
						Connect with Supportive People- Talking with other people leads to the release of hormones that reduce stress. Lean on people
						who are willing to listen to you and engage in productive conversations.

					</li>
					<li>
						Carve out Hobby Time- Engage in activities that bring you pleasure and joy; research shows that reduces stress by almost
						half and lowers your heart rate as well. This can also help you express yourself, which is a great way to release all
						of that pent up stress.

					</li>
					<li>
						Practice Meditation, Stress Reduction or Yoga- Refer to our meditation or yoga page for more information.

					</li>
					<li>
						Sleep Enough- Refer to our page about sleep’s effects on stress for more information.

					</li>
					<li>
						Bond with a Pet- Many studies show that spending any amount of time with a pet can reduce anxiety levels almost by half.

					</li>
					<li>
						See a Counselor, Coach or Therapist- Refer to the seeking help page for more information

					</li>
