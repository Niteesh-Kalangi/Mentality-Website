						Walking - This is perhaps the most simple way to calm yourself down. In fact, studies show that a simple ten minute walk can be just as effective at reducing stress as a walk that is twice or three times as long.
					</li>
					<li>
						Jogging or Running - Assuming your body is able to handle it, running can reduce stress at an even faster rate because of the increased amount of oxygen intake during the running period. Just make sure you have an open and safe space to run.
					</li>
					<li>
						Swimming - There are many aspects of swimming that can optimize the stress reducing process. For example, swimming is an all-body activity, meaning it requires the work of all parts of the body, which makes it great for the cardiovascular system. Additionally, the element of water can add another soothing effect that reduces stress.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cycling - This is an easy workout that can reduce stress because of soothing feelings that it can produce like the feeling of wind blowing against you or going down a hill. Just be sure to follow all the safety precautions necessary.

			<h1 class="information-topic">How does Diet Affect Stress?</h1>
        <ol class="information-steps-list" type="1">
					<li>
						One of the main reasons stress is so prevalent and prominent is because of the state of our bodies and how that health can affect our capabilities to cope with tension. A healthy diet works to build a strong, more enduring foundation for the body by optimizing all of the mechanisms in our bodies. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Stress negatively affects blood pressure and blood flow. Brain blood flow is vital to brain health. Nutrients from healthy foods can help improve blood-flow to the brain. Unhealthy foods like chips and cookies and other refined carbohydrates can cause a spike in blood sugar, followed by a crash, leading to increased stress and anxiety. Choosing healthier foods can have the opposite effect, creating hormone signaling in the brain that leads to mood regulation, sleep, and energy balance. 

					</li>
					<li>
						Stress can also affect your diet as much as diet affects stress, causing a positive feedback loop of unhealthy eating habits, starting with cravings caused by stress. For example, stress has been linked to causing overeating, ramping up hormones like cortisol, insulin, and ghrelin, which can increase cravings for unhealthy foods, and this unhealthy eating style can lead to an even higher level of stress in the long-term.
